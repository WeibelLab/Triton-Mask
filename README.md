# Triton-Mask

This document outlines the specifications for the Triton-Mask developed at UC San Diego as a possible solution for PPE shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Triton-Mask is an Emergency-Use Mask with a high-grade filtration and fit, comparable to standard N-95 respirators.

## Product Description
We and others have identified readily available material that filters 99% of particulates according to our tests and manufacturing specifications. We designed a respirator that provides 0.01% particulate penetration during normal breathing which can be deployed for public use, however, in order to enable scaling up future production and distribution more resources are needed.

Our overall goal is to empower anyone in need in California and beyond to readily access quality respirators that enable protection from the Coronavirus. We want the general population to be able to produce, or locally obtain, face masks with filtration and fit as close as possible to the protection warranted by current standards such as the N95 respirators. To provide generalizable access across populations with varying access to tools and materials, we aim to create a number of designs for DIY respirators that can be produced easily and with various local resources such as small-scale 3D printing facilities, easy-to-find filtration material, sewing, casting and other techniques.

## Clinical Applicability and Buy-In
We have received positive feedback to continue making these DIY respirators from top leadership within various departments in the UC San Diego Health Systems such as Surgery, the Emergency Department, and Infectious Diseases. Building off the success we have had with this respirators design, we are also working on optimizing the mask shape to universally seal on all individuals’ faces and provide the seal needed for medical-grade protection. The hope here is to also alleviate the stress on resources available for healthcare workers.
